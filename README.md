## User Stories
-> As a user, I want to be able to check if the cards are the same which are being matched.<br>
-> As a user, I want to check my time taken.<br>
-> As a user, I want to know my score or at least the moves.

## Major Hurdles (All credits are given to the respective contributors in my [**credits.txt**](https://github.com/jayanth920/project-1/blob/main/files/credits.txt))
-> For me the css styling was a big blocker when the game container did not come to the center.But after watching few tutorials on flexbox, I finally did it.<br>
-> The logic of shuffling the cards and generating them in my website was a problem , but solved it with a video of FreeCodeCamp.
